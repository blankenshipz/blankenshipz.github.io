![A picture of me](/images/me.jpg)

👋 I'm Zach; I've spent the last decade of my career working on Engineering problems for businesses spanning from small non-profits to major multinational corporations. In recent years my primary focus has been on developing and deploying infrastructure. If pressed I would say that I'm a Software Engineer stuck in a "DevOps" world.

I'm really terrible about maintaining a blog; as of this writing (07/21) the only entry I have is from 2017 - Let's hope that 2021 is a good year for creating content! 🤞

I plan to use this space as way to explore new ideas rather then to expound on things I'm "knowledgeable" about so it's likely that you find mistakes and misunderstandings; _when_ you find something please drop a line in the [issues](https://github.com/blankenshipz/blankenshipz.github.io/issues) so it can be fixed 🙏
